# FergusonIRestaurantPickerEndPoints


This Program will be run through an API (PostMan) the user will input our local host HTML For Example(https://localhost:7212/) and then type in RestaurantPicker/RestaurantPicker/(1 of 3 choices "asian", "fast", "sit down") and then another / (1 of 2 choices denpending on their first choice Ex: pho or sushi)

//Peer Reviewed by: Marcel R- The program worked well. It took two imputs to narrow down what to get to eat. I like how it returns that wasn't an option if entered incorrectly. Really good work! :D
